            To empower people to unlock the joy of discovery, feel the wonder of
            creation and better harness the world's knowledge, today we're
            improving how the world benefits from the web by reinventing the
            tools billions of people use every day, the search engine and the
            browser. Today, we're launching an all new, AI-powered Bing search
            engine and Edge browser, available in preview now at Bing.com, to
            deliver better search, more complete answers, a new chat experience
            and the ability to generate content. We think of these tools as an
            AI copilot for the web.
